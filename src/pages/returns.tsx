              </p>

              <h2>3. Order Cancellation</h2>

              <h3>3.1 Before Shipment</h3>
              <p>
                Customers may request cancellation of an order before it is shipped by the distributor. Cancellation requests can be submitted through the "My Orders" section on the Platform.
              </p>

              <h3>3.2 After Shipment</h3>
              <p>
                Once an order has been shipped by the distributor, cancellation is generally not possible. Customers may refuse delivery or contact the distributor directly to arrange a return after delivery.
              </p>

              <h3>3.3 Cancellation of Online Paid Orders</h3>
              <p>
                If an order paid via online payment (PhonePe) is cancelled before shipment, the Platform may facilitate an automated refund to the original payment method through the payment gateway. This automated facilitation is provided as a convenience and does not constitute BuildAdda accepting any obligation or liability for the refund. Refund processing times depend on the payment gateway (PhonePe) and the customer's bank, typically 5-10 business days.
              </p>

              <h3>3.4 Cash on Delivery Orders</h3>
              <p>
                COD orders cancelled before shipment incur no charges. No refund processing is required for undelivered COD orders.
              </p>

              <h2>4. Returns</h2>

              <h3>4.1 Return Eligibility</h3>
              <p>
                Return eligibility is determined solely by the respective distributor/seller. Generally, the following guidelines may apply, but distributors may set their own terms:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Products must be reported within 7 days of delivery</li>
                <li>Products must be unused, in original condition, and in original packaging</li>
                <li>Proof of purchase (order number) must be provided</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4.2 Non-Returnable Items</h3>
              <p>
                The following categories are generally non-returnable (subject to distributor's individual policy):
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Products that have been used, installed, or altered</li>
                <li>Custom-made or specially ordered products</li>
                <li>Products without original packaging or labels</li>
                <li>Cement bags that have been opened</li>
                <li>Cut or modified materials (tiles, pipes, etc.)</li>
                <li>Products purchased on clearance or final sale</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4.3 Return Process</h3>
              <p>
                Customers should contact the distributor/seller directly to initiate a return. The Platform may provide communication tools to facilitate this process, but BuildAdda is not a party to the return transaction.

              <p>
                For orders paid online via PhonePe, refunds (when approved by the distributor or triggered by pre-shipment cancellation) are processed back to the original payment method through the payment gateway. Typical processing time is 5-10 business days, depending on the payment gateway and the customer's financial institution. BuildAdda facilitates this process as a technology intermediary only.
              </p>

              <h3>5.3 COD Refunds</h3>
              <p>
                For COD orders, any refund must be arranged directly between the customer and the distributor/seller. BuildAdda does not facilitate COD refund transfers.
              </p>

              <h3>5.4 Refund Amount</h3>
              <p>
                Refund amounts are determined by the distributor/seller and may be subject to deductions for shipping, handling, or restocking as per the distributor's individual policy. BuildAdda has no control over refund amounts.
